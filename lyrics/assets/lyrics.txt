00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:26,000
I found a love for me

2
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,400
Darling just dive right in

3
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,900
And follow my lead

4
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:42,000
Well I found a girl beautiful
and sweet

5
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:49,300
I never knew you were the
someone waiting for me

6
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:54,100
'Cause we were just kids
when we fell in love

7
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,000
Not knowing what it was

8
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:05,650
I will not give you up this time

9
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:12,900
But darling, just kiss me slow,
your heart is all I own

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,100
And in your eyes you're holding mine

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:31,100
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
with you between my arms

12
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:38,200
****foot on the grass, listening
to our favorite song

13
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:45,300
When you said you looked a mess, I
whispered underneath my breath

14
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:53,300
But you heard it, darling,
you look perfect tonight

15
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:05,600
Well I found a woman, stronger
than anyone I know

16
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:13,700
She shares my dreams, I hope that
someday I'll share her home

17
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:21,800
I found a love, to carry more
than just my secrets

18
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:28,100
To carry love, to carry
children of our own

19
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,700
We are still kids, but
we're so in love

20
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,500
Fighting against all odds

21
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:44,100
I know we'll be alright this time

22
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,600
Darling, just hold my hand

23
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,600
Be my girl, I'll be your man

24
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:58,100
I see my future in your eyes

25
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:09,600
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark,
with you between my arms

26
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:16,700
****foot on the grass, listening
to our favorite song

27
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,700
When I saw you in that dress,
looking so beautiful

28
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:31,400
I don't deserve this, darling,
you look perfect tonight

29
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:55,000
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark,
with you between my arms

30
00:03:55,100 --> 00:04:02,000
****foot on the grass, listening
to our favorite song

31
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,400
I have faith in what I see

32
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:11,800
Now I know I have met
an angel in person

33
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,700
And she looks perfect

34
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,700
I don't deserve this

35
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:24,300
You look perfect tonight

36
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:34,300
