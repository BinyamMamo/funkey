Funkey is a web application designed to help users improve their typing skills in a fun and engaging way. Users can practice typing in three different modes:

1. **Lyrics Typing üéß**
   - Users can type the lyrics of popular songs. They can choose from a list of pre-selected songs or upload their own lyrics.

   - Users can practice typing sentences that resemble real-world content.
